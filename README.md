Crowdsourced list of words censored on YouNow
---------------------------------------------

* See [BadWords.md](BadWords.md) for an (incomplete) list of words censored
  on YouNow.
* See [SurprisinglyNotBadWords.md](SurprisinglyNotBadWords.md) for an (also
  incomplete) list of words that, surprisingly, are actually *not* censored,
  but maybe should have been.

Currently, we're not actually sure whether longer words are also censored if
they only contain any (and yes, *any*) part of a shorter word on the known
blacklist. Here is some evidence to support both cases:

### Longer words banned as part of shorter words
* musik (sik)

### Allowed longer words which contain a part on the blacklist
* schmiernippel (nippel)

Contributions are always welcome in order to make both lists a bit less
incomplete!
