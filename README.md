Crowdsourced list of words censored in YouNow's chat
----------------------------------------------------

* See [BadWords.md](BadWords.md) for an (incomplete) list of words censored
  in YouNow's chat.
* See [SurprisinglyNotBadWords.md](SurprisinglyNotBadWords.md) for an (also
  incomplete) list of words that, surprisingly, are actually *not* censored,
  but maybe should have been.

Please keep in mind that longer words are also censored if they only contain
any (and yes, *any*) part of a shorter word on the blacklist. In order to keep
the list small, those longer words won't be added.

Contributions are always welcome in order to make both lists a bit less incomplete!
